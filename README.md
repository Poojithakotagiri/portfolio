I have begun familiarizing myself with various testing methodologies, including manual testing, automated testing, and performance testing. I am particularly interested in learning about testing tools such as Selenium and JUnit, which can streamline the testing process and enhance software efficiency. My goal is to understand how to create effective test cases, identify bugs, and contribute to delivering high-quality software solutions.My strengths include time management, effective communication, teamwork, and a strong ability to learn quickly.
